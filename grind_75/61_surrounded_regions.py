Title: Surrounded Regions

Description:
Given an `m x n` matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example 1:
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Example 2:
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
