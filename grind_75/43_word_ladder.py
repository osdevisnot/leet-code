Title: Word Ladder

Description:
Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, such that:
1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
