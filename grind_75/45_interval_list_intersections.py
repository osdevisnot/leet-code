Title: Interval List Intersections

Description:
You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and `secondList[j] = [start_j, end_j]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

Example 1:
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

Example 2:
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []
