Title: Valid Palindrome

Description:
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, it is "amanaplanacanalpanama", which is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, it is "raceacar", which is not a palindrome.
