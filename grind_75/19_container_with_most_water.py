Title: Container With Most Water

Description:
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The vertical lines are drawn at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
The two lines together form the container, and they can hold 49 units of water.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
