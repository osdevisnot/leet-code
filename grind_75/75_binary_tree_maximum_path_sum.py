Title: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Description:
A path in a binary tree is any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
