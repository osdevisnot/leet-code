Title: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Description:
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:
- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.

Find the minimum element of the rotated array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
